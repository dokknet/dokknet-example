# Welcome to Dokknet Example Integration

This is an example site showcasing a [Dokknet Paywall](https://dokknet.com)  integration. 
You can click the "Toggle Paywall" link at the top of the page to see how a paywalled page would be presented to a user.

[Dokknet Paywall](https://dokknet.com) lets open source developers add a paywall to their documentation sites to make money. 
The paywall is designed to be unobtrusive and user and SEO friendly. 
The paywall is only triggered for heavy users, so we have a "Toggle Paywall" button in the top right corner to make it easier to showcase it.

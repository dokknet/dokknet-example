# Welcome to Dokknet Example Integration

This is an example site showcasing a [Dokknet Paywall](https://dokknet.com)  integration. 
The [Dokknet Paywall](https://dokknet.com) lets open source developers add a paywall to their documentation sites to earn a regular income. 
The paywall is designed to be unobtrusive and user and SEO friendly. 

The paywall is only triggered for daily users, so we have a **"Toggle Paywall"** button in the top right corner to make it easier to showcase it.
